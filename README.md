## Overview

## Docker
Build an image without uploading it:

1. Set the environment variables with eval: `$(minikube docker-env)`
2. Build the image with the Docker daemon of Minukube: `docker build -t my-image`
3. Set the image in the pod spec like the build tag: `my-image`
4. Set the `imagePullPolicy` to `Never`, otherwise Kubernetes will try to download the image

> Important note: You have to run eval $(minikube docker-env) on each terminal you want to use, since it only sets the environment variables for the current shell session.
